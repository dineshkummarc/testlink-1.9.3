===============================================================

TestLink is a web based test management and test execution system.
It enables quality assurance teams to create and manage their test 
cases as well as to organize them into test plans. These test plans 
allow team members to execute test cases and track test results 
dynamically.

TestLink is a GPL licensed open source project. All of the source code 
behind TestLink is freely available for download via SourceForge 
at http://www.sourceforge.net If you are interested in contributing 
to the TestLink effort feel free to contact us.
There is no hidden fee - 100% free for using!


2. Release notes
===============================================================

This release contains bugfixes for 1.9.0/1.9.1/1.9.2
   
See CHANGELOG file for detailed list of issues fixed.


3. System Requirements - server
===============================================================

Server environment should consists from:
- web-server: Apache 1.2 , 2.x
- PHP 5.2, 5.3
- DBMS: MySQL 5.x , Postgres 8.x,9.x , MS-SQL 2005/2008

Supported client web-browsers: 
- Firefox 3.x
- Internet Explorer 6.x, 7.x, 8.x
- Chrome   


4. Installation
===============================================================
The following details the basic steps for installation on any   
system. 
Instructions may seem unix-centric but should work on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes 
to install, configure, and be using TestLink.

Short summary:
 1. Transfer files
 2. Uncompress files
 3. Launch web based installer

1. First, transfer the file to your web-server using whatever 
method you like best (ftp, scp, etc).  You will need to telnet/ssh 
into the server machine for the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Total Commander, Winzip, and other programs should also be able 
to handle decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something 
different to 'testlink'. You should allow write access for
logging, upload and template directories.

3. Launch web based installer
We will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file. From your web server, access http://yoursite/testlink/ 
or similar URL and follow instructions.

Check Installation manual and TestLink forum if you meet a problem.


5. Upgrade and Migration
===============================================================
When accessing Installer page you will found following options:

 - New Installation
 - Migration from 1.8 to 1.9.1/2/3

If you are upgrading from 1.9.0 please go to section 'Upgrade from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1/2/3'.
If you are upgrading from 1.9.1/2 NO DB upgrades will be needed.

 Steps
 - Make a Backup of your current database.
 - Using  a NEW DIRECTORY (DO NOT OVERWRITE your old installation),  
   do only following steps from Install procedure:
                                           Transfer files
                                           Uncompress files
 - Copy your old config_db.inc.php and custom_config.inc.php to NEW DIRECTORY.
 - Launch TestLink
 - TestLink will check Database version, and if some upgrade/migration 
   is needed will launch automatically the installer.

 If you are updating a same major version (for example 1.7.0 to 1.7.1) 
 you need to use Upgrade Database.
 
 If you are using a different major version detailed in options,  
 you need to use the specific Migrations.
 
 If in some steps TestLink ask you for two databases, NEVER use 
 same name from both.
 
 If you do not find nothing useful, post in forum
   
 Always before login, after an upgrade/migration clear browser cookies.

- Upgrade from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1+
To be able to use Testlink 1.9.1+ with the new „Requirement Revisioning“ feature - 
migration procedure requires some manual steps. 

A.) Why does this release need manual steps on migration from 1.9.0?
„Requirement Revisioning“ Feature requires database changes. 
Manual migration is simple and should not be a problem for anyone. 
No data needs to be migrated – it only requires to alter some tables and create a single new table.

B.) What steps have to be executed for migration from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1+?
1. First of all make sure your testlink installation uses testlink 1.9.0 database scheme. 
If you are still on Testlink 1.8.x use standard upgrade procedure.

2. a) Execute install/sql/alter_tables/1.9.1/<your_db>/DB1.4/step1/db_schema_update.sql
	 b) Execute install/sql/alter_tables/1.9.1/<your_db>/DB1.4/stepZ/z_final_step.sql
	 WARNING: if you are using a table prefix replace /*prefix*/ with your prefix

	 Hint: When using MySQL Query Browser make sure you are not using a single command execution. 
	      (open script or use special script tab to execute the whole script at once)
